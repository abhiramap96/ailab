Trial 1 with features:- sepal_length=3.7, sepal_width=4.9, petal_length=5.2, petal_width=3.3 predicted species "virginica" 
Trial 2 with features:- sepal_length=2.7, sepal_width=3.8, petal_length=4.8, petal_width=5.2 predicted species "virginica" 
Here we can see in both trials the model classified the features into the species "virginica". A model always predicts the  
class label of a testing data based on the training data. Here since the features we provided for testing is more similar 
to "virginica" as trained, the ML model classified it so. In both cases, there is no big difference in features so it is 
obvious to be in the same class.
